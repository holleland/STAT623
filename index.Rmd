# Course overview {-}

## Learning outcomes and objectives{-}
The course presents various advanced methods within data science for predictive modelling and the use of R. Methods for regression, including non-linear regression and generalized additive models, and methods for classification, including trees, boosting and Support Vector Machines, will be examined. The course will focus on practical use in r, without going into details of the mathematical theory of the methods. 

On completion of the course the student should have the following learning outcomes:

####  Knowledge{-}

- Knows the basic ideas underpinning carious methods in data science/predictive modelling

#### Skills{-}

- Can implement various models within data science/predictive modelling in R
- Use data science methods on real data sets and perform predictions

#### General competence{-}

- Have an overview of how data science methods can be used to analyze larger data sets
