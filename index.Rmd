# Course overview {-}

## Learning outcomes {-}
After completing this course, students should 

- Be able to make their own models for different situations using methods such as: linear regression, multiple regression, generalized additive models, splines, support vector machines, decision trees, etc. 
- Become native speakers of the R language. 
- ....
